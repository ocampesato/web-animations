web-animations
==============

Graphics and animation based on Web Animations, Polymer, and SVG that add animation effects to the Polymer and SVG code samples in the polymer-svg repository.

After downloading the code samples as well as installing bower on your machine, run this command: bower install

The preceding command will install the dependencies for the code samples.

Next, launch a local server (such as: python -m SimpleHTTPServer) in the directory with the code samples, launch a browser session, and navigate to http://localhost:8000 

Launch any of the HTML Web pages with an "Anim" prefix to see animation effects (e.g., AnimArchOvals1.html).

Launch any of the other HTML Web pages without an "Anim" or a "Poly" prefix to see the corresponding "static" effects (e.g., ArchOvals1.html).

In addition, AnimArchOvals1.html summarizes the animation-related code variations in this repository.

NB: these code samples are intended for entertainment, and they do not necessarily contain "best practices", nor are they intended for a production website.
